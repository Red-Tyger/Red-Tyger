- 👋 Hi, I’m @Red-Tyger/Tiny Tiger
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring scripting and applications in Python, particularly in the context of building tools for hardware administration. Currently, my abilities are restricted to writing silly little games, but I'm learning...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of Python and scripting in general, plus some Microsoft 365 administration tools for my current occupation. I'm also still learning the particulars of GitHub, so please bear with me. I'll see where this particular path takes me. Of course, working in a support role for my day job provides plenty of learning opportunities to see how Enterprise Networks function in the Wild. In addition, I've dabbled in some front-end HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building tools that would be useful in a help desk or deskside support context.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can message me via GitHub, at least until a need for more direct communication is needed.
